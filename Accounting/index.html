		<h1>Accounting Studying Guide</h1>
		<p>Finals will soon be upon us and unfortunately the accounting final is comprehensive.
		Rather than rush to study for all of your finals at the end of the year, this website
		has all of the formulas and processes that you might need to know.</p>

		<h2>Unit 2 Terms</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Administrative costs: All costs associated with the management of an organization.</li>
			<li>Controllable costs: Variable costs such as raw materials and labour that can be largely influenced by management.</li> 
			<li>Conversion cost: is the cost of direct labour plus the cost of manufacturing overhead.</li>
			<li>Cost behaviour: The way in which a cost reacts or responds to changes in levels of business activity</li>
			<li>Cost of goods manufactured: the cost associated with the production of finished goods during the time period.</li>
			<li>Finished goods: Units of product that have been completed and are ready to be sold but have not yet been sold</li>
			<li>Fixed cost: A cost that remains consistent regardless of changes in business activity within a relevant range. If a fixed cost is expressed on a per-unit basis, it varies with the level of activity.</li>
			<li>Indirect labour: The costs of workers who are not directly responsible for the creation of a particular product. Examples could be supervisors, janitors, material handlers (transportation), or maintenance staff</li>
			<li>Indirect materials: Small items of material such as glue and nails. These items may become an important part of a finished product but are only traceable to the product with great cost or inconvenience.</li>
			<li>Manufacturing: to make something on a large scale using machinery. In terms of cost accounting the manufacturing cost refers to the cost incurred to produce the goods during a certain period.</li>
			<li>Marketing or selling costs: All costs necessary to complete the customer’s order and get the finished product (or service) to them.	</li>
			<li>Period costs: all costs that are not included in product costs such as administrative expenses</li>
			<li>Prime cost: Direct materials and direct labour costs, the immediate cost of manufacturing products</li>
			<li>Product costs: All costs that are involved in acquiring or making a product. In the case of manufactured goods, these costs consist of direct labour, direct materials, and manufacturing overhead</li>
			<li>Raw materials: The materials that are used to make a product</li>
			<li>Variable cost: A cost that changes in accordance to the changes in business activity</li>
			<li>Work in process: Units of product that are only partially complete and will require further work before they can be sold.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Unit 3 Terms</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Activity Base – A measure of whatever causes the occurrence of a variable cost. For example, the total cost of ice-cream cones at Dairy Queen will increase as the amount of ice cream sold increases.</li>
			<li>Break-Even Analysis – An analysis method used to determine the number of jobs or products that need to be sold to reach a break even point for a business</li>
			<li>Break-Even Point – Is the volume point at which revenue and costs are equal; a combination of sales and costs that will yield no profit or loss</li>
			<li>Committed Fixed Costs – Those fixed costs that are deemed permanent regardless of annual decisions by management since removing them would be harmful for the business such as manufacturing plants. </li>
			<li>Contribution Margin – Total sales revenue minus all variable production, selling, and administrative costs per unit</li>
			<li>Contribution Margin per Unit – You can probably determine the variable production costs for each product. If sales commissions are a factor those can be easily added in as well. </li>
			<li>Contribution margin per unit = contribution margin divided by units sold.</li>
			<li>Cost Behaviour – refers to the way a cost changes in relation to changes in an activity level.</li>
			<li>CVP - What does it stand for? Cost, Volume, Profit</li>
			<li>CVP Analysis – The process of examining the relationships among revenues, costs, and profits for a relevant range of activity and for a particular time period.</li>
			<li>Discretionary Fixed Costs – Those fixed costs that arise from annual decisions by management to spend in certain fixed cost areas, such as advertising and research.</li>
			<li>Relevant Range – The specified range of activity over which a variable cost remains constant per unit or a fixed cost remains fixed in total</li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Unit 3B Terms</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Contribution margin ratio (CM ratio) - The contribution margin as a percentage of total sales</li>
			<li>Cost-volume-profit (CVP) graph - A graph that highlights CVP relationships over wide ranges of activity</li>
			<li>Degree of operating leverage -  A measure, at a given level of sales, of how a percentage change in sales volume will affect profits. The degree of operating leverage is computed by dividing contribution margin by net income.</li>
			<li>Incremental analysis - An analytical approach that focuses only on those items of revenue, cost, and volume that will change as a result of a decision</li>
			<li>Margin of safety - The excess of budgeted (or actual) sales over the break-even volume of sales</li>
			<li>Operating leverage - A measure of how sensitive net income is to a given percentage change in sales. It is computed by dividing the contribution margin by net income.</li>
			<li>Sales mix – The relative proportions in which a company’s products are sold</li>
			<li>Target income – The net income that will be produced when a certain number (or the expected number) of units are sold</li>
		</ul>
