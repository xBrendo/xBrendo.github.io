		<p>Finals will soon be upon us and unfortunately the physical science final is comprehensive.
		Rather than rush to study for all of your finals at the end of the year, this website
		has all of the formulas and facts that you might need to know.</p>
		<h2>History of the Atom </h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Ancient Greeks, notably Democritus, hypothesized that all matter was made of tiny, indivisible pieces </li>
			<li>Aristotle disagreed and believed that all matter was made from earth, fire, water, and air. Since Aristotle was far more popular his theories overruled the idea of the atom</li>
			<li>John Dalton resurrected the atomic theory and unlike the ancient Greeks he had experimental evidence. He proposed the billiard ball model of the atom. All atoms were smooth, solid, and identical throughout.</li>
			<li>J.J, Thompson discovered the electron. He hypothesized that protons must also exist since atoms have no charge. Proposed the plum pudding model that claimed that electrons were scattered throughout a positively charged sphere. </li>
			<li>Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus of an atom. The cloud model of the atom that most of the mass of in the nucleus at the center of an atom surrounded by a cloud of electrons</li>
			<li>James Chadwick discovered neutrons </li>
			<li>Niels Bohr developed the Bohr model of the atom that had electrons existing at precise, quantized distances from the nucleus </li>
			<li>Bohr's model specifies an exact path the electron takes around a nucleus. We know from wave particle duality that this can not be an electrons position and momentum can not be simultaneously determined </li>
			<li>The Quantum Mechanical Model of the atom is derived from mathematical solutions to Schroedinger's equation. It determines the allowed energies an electron can have and how likely it is to find an electron in various locations around the nucleus of an atom the suborbital of its quantum number</li>
